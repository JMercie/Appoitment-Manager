# Appoitment-Manager

## Use case

This repository was made thinking on a personal project that I never ended using, but I think that if you want a first approach to go to create
a simple API that read/write from a DB using a ORM, it's a decent template of where to start.

## Contributing

If you have any suggestion on how to improve it, to help others have a better understanding of the code and improve the quality. I would love to review that PR.
